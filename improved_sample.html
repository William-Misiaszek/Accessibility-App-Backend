content='The provided HTML content does not fully comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA standards. Below are the specific issues and the suggested improvements to enhance its accessibility:\n\n1. **Missing Alt Attributes for Images:**\n\n```html\n<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image"> <!-- Added alt attribute for better screen reader compatibility -->\n```\n- **Improvement:** Every `<img>` tag should have an alt attribute to describe the image content or function for screen readers. If the image is purely decorative and doesn\'t add information to the content, use `alt=""` to mark it as such.\n\n2. **Low Contrast Text:**\n\n```html\n<p style="color: #757575; background-color: white;">Low contrast text</p> <!-- Improved contrast ratio -->\n```\n- **Improvement:** The color contrast between the text (grey) and its background (white) is too low for users with visual impairments. Changing the text color to a darker shade (e.g., #757575) improves contrast. The WCAG 2.1 AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text.\n\n3. **Non-descriptive Link Text:**\n\n```html\n<a href="javascript:void(0);" aria-label="Learn more about our services">Click here</a> <!-- Added ARIA label for descriptive link text -->\n```\n- **Improvement:** Link text should be descriptive of the link\'s destination or function. Using "Click here" is not descriptive and can be confusing out of context. Adding an `aria-label` provides screen readers with a clear description.\n\n4. **Form Input Without Label:**\n\n```html\n<label for="name">Name:</label><input type="text" id="name" name="name"> <!-- Added label for form input -->\n```\n- **Improvement:** Every form input should have a corresponding `<label>` that describes its purpose. Associating a label with an input field using the `for` and `id` attributes improves accessibility.\n\n5. **Non-accessible Interactive Element:**\n\n```html\n<button onclick="alert(\'More Info\');">More Info</button> <!-- Changed div to button for keyboard accessibility -->\n```\n- **Improvement:** Interactive elements should be accessible via keyboard. A `<div>` with an `onclick` event is not inherently keyboard-accessible. Changing it to a `<button>` makes it focusable and usable with a keyboard, without needing additional attributes.\n\n6. **Skipping Heading Levels:**\n\n```html\n<h1>Page Title</h1>\n<h2>Subsection Heading</h2> <!-- Changed h3 to h2 for proper heading hierarchy -->\n```\n- **Improvement:** Heading levels should not be skipped as they provide structure and navigation for screen reader users. If the `<h1>` is the highest level, the next subheading should be an `<h2>`, not an `<h3>`.\n\nThese improvements address the key accessibility issues in the provided HTML content, making it more compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Enhanced accessibility benefits not only users with disabilities but also improves the overall user experience and potentially search engine rankings.' response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 654, 'prompt_tokens': 337, 'total_tokens': 991}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4-turbo-preview', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_13c70b9f70', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}
